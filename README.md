# Nithilan's Physics Blog and Study Materials

I am currently a senior physics major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My main idea is to take subjects I have studied during undergrad and translate it to a more understandable material for other physics major or even physics enthusiats who would like to learn. My primary focus is quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and particle physics. I will be covering topics both in math and physics with lots of solved problems. 

On my medium sit I will be covering on different research papers that have come out and helping a wider audience who do not have a strong mathematical and physics background to understand the interesting things being found in the world of physics.

I hope you guys have fun and learn a lot. You can send questions and queires to me at nithilanp@gmail.com and I will try to help you.

For my current block which I will be going over, the topics are: Introductory Quantum Mechanics, Qauntum computing, General Relativity, and Mathematical Methods of physics. In each of the site I will give the various resources which I used to help make this.
